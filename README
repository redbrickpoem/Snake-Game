This is my second project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

I've recreated the classic Snake Game using multiple classes and modules to strengthen my understanding of OOP concepts through practical application.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Snake movement controlled via arrow keys
- Random food generation
- Snake grows upon eating food
- Scoreboard updates in real-time
- Collision detection:
  - Snake hits wall = Game Over
  - Snake collides with itself = Game Over
- Game boundary rendering with Turtle graphics

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Practiced

- Class and object creation
- Encapsulation (each module has a separate responsibility)
- Inheritance (used in `Scoreboard` class)
- Modular design and code organization

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Turtle Graphics module (for GUI rendering)
- Random module (for food placement)
- Time module (for controlling game speed)

## 📂 Project Structure
Snake Game/ │ 
├── main.py # Entry point - handles game loop and controls 
├── snake.py # Snake class - handles creation, movement, growth 
├── movement.py # Movement class - controls direction input 
├── Food.py # Food class - handles spawning food 
├── scorecard.py # Scoreboard class - tracks and displays score 
├── GameBoundary.py # Game boundary class - draws borders and checks collision 
|── README.md # You're reading it!
